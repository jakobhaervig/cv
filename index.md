### Focusing on

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), OpenFOAM, Workflow automation, CI/CD, Data reduction, Scientific coding, Python

## Experience

`2020 - now`
__Research Group Leader of Multiphase Flows and Heat transfer, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2022 - now`
__Associate Professor, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2022 - now`
__Member of steering committee, DaCES (Danish Centre for Energy Storage)__

`2019 - now`
__Board member, DANSIS (The Danish Society for Industrial Fluid Dynamics)__

`2018 - 2022`
__Assistant Professor, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2014 - 2017`
__PhD Student, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__
__Focus was on fluid dynamics using computational methods. The adhesive behaviour of small micron-sized particles in turbulent flows was investigated by coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using the open-source software LIGGGHTS, CFDEM and OpenFOAM.__

`2016 - 2016`
__Visiting Researcher, Technical University Munich, Germany__

`2013 - 2013`
__Trainee, Grundfos Holding A/S, Bjerringbro, Denmark__

## Education
`2023`
__Project Leadership and Management, CBS HD2, Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, Denmark.__

`2019`
__Adjunct Pedagogy, AAU Learning Lab, Aalborg, Denmark.__
- Thesis title: Motivation-Focused Group Facilitation

`2014 - 2017`
