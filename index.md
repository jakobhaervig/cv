## Experience

`2020 - now`
__Research Group Leader of Multiphase Flows and Heat transfer, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2022 - now`
__Associate Professor, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2022 - now`
__Member of steering committee, DaCES (Danish Centre for Energy Storage)__

`2019 - now`
__Board member, DANSIS (The Danish Society for Industrial Fluid Mechanics)__

`2018 - 2022`
__Assistant Professor, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__

`2014 - 2017`
__PhD Student, AAU Energy, Aalborg University__
- Focus was on fluid dynamics using computational methods. The adhesive behaviour of small micron-sized particles in turbulent flows was investigated by coupling the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using the open-source software LIGGGHTS, CFDEM and OpenFOAM.

`2016 - 2016`
__Visiting Researcher, Technical University Munich, Germany__

`2013 - 2013`
__Trainee, Grundfos Holding A/S, Bjerringbro, Denmark__
